1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
I chose to use Java to build out the application due to my previous coursework and experience with it. I also used Gradle as an easy way to deploy my application, and also Postman as the way to interact with the application with the various functions
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
The advantages would be the ease of use and the ease of deployment, although this solution may not work with many different users.
3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
My favorite personal project was my Mentis hackathon project because that was my first experience with web development and it allowed me to improve my skills in a short timeframe and taught me how to solve problems in an efficient and accurate way.
